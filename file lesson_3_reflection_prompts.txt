When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Most of the time so that the local directory is always up to date.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that my commit history is organized and I am not surprised with all the changes that had been made plus the mergin conflicts that might be introduced with such pull.
